# ROAD Transkribus API by Jeremy Farley

> The following is a description of the Transkribus website, it's available services and my impressions of it.

## Sign-Up
Once you register on the website, you will receive an authentication email which provides a link back to the website main page. At the top of this webpage are several menu options:

*  Transkribus - which provides optionis to read up on the Transkribus' origins, the TranskrivbusLite app, Plans and Pricing, list of Public AI models, metagraph api which describes the software that trascribes handwritten words and the transkribus.ai section.
*  ScanTent - a specially made tent enclosure used to diffuse light so you can make scans in the field with a smartphone, also comes with an ai powered app for high quality scans.
*  read&search - Transkribus allows you to publish your documents online either for the general public or a small group, and allows you to display the doc image and transcription side by side and allow you to search the collection.
*  About - shows info on the websites' members, team, success stories, news and job applications.
*  Resources - includes the help center, glossary, events, documentation for developers, download client, insight blog and scholarship programme.
*  Plans & Pricing - another link to the pricing plans page, showcasing the tiers and what services they provide.
*  App - from this link you can access TranskribusLite and begin transcribing documents.

> Scroll down a little, and there is an embeded transcriber where you can drag and drop/browse your computer for a single image and test the transkribus software. Once the transcription is complete you can download this example in pdf or word.
## Opening TranskribusLite App 
After entering the TrankribusLite 2.0 app, the upper third has five sections to choose from:

*  Desk - the screen starts on the desk section where the recent documents and collections you have worked on appear and where new documents can be uploaded for transcription.
*  Models - where new models can be trained as a part of the softwares machine learning capabilities.
*  Sites - where the collections you upload can be published wither for the general public or a small group of stakeholders.
*  Jobs -  once a doc is uploaded and/or a transcription started, the job is listed here in a pop-up you can then expand into a window on its own with more info.
*  User Account - where the user profile, language, user tier and logout options are available.

## Using the App
> The following steps are taken to complete a transcription:
*  On the __desk__ section, the recent collections are displayed and an __upload files__ button is shown in grey towards the top right of the page alongside a __quick text recognition__ button in blue.
*  Selecting the __upload files__ you a new collection is created and can be assigned a name that does not conflict with any of the other docs that may be in a collection.
*  Once you drag and drop/browse and choose the image you want to use, a __job__ starts for the upload and can take a few seconds for a single page and likely minutes for larger collections of images.
*  Once that upload job completes, the image can be opened into a new screen where the image is displayed on the left side, and the transcription on the right but the screen is blank to start. From this screen, the image can be split into regions, the layout set, the image rotated as necessary etc.
*  On the right screen you select the trancribe button, then select what language/model you want to use to complete the transcription and then start the process.
  > I transcribed an image on Friday night but the job didn't finish running until Saturday morning, but I ran another one on Saturday evening and it completed in less than a minute. Which suggests to me that on the free tier you do not have priority for running processes, so it can sometimes take hours to complete a job. However, since we don't have access to the payed tier at this time a proper comparison can't be made to verify my thoughts.
